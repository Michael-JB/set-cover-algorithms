# set-cover-algorithms
A repository containing C++ implementations of a range of approximation algorithms for the **Set Cover** problem:

  - Disk-based DFG [[1]](#1)
  - RAM-based DFG [[1]](#1)
  - Naive Progressive Greedy [[2]](#2)
  - Progressive Greedy [[2]](#2)
  - Emek-Rosen Semi-Streaming Set Cover [[3]](#3)
  - Multi-pass Semi-Streaming Set Cover

## Usage
Each implementation is contained its own directory. Usage instructions are given in corresponding `README.md` files.

### Data sets
These implementations operate on a common data format: a text file with one set per line, where each set is a space-delimited list of integers. See `input-example.dat` for an example.

All algorithms have the option of outputting a cover. This cover is a text file containing a set index on each line.
